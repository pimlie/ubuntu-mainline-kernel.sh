ubuntu-mainline-kernel.sh
=================

Bash script for Ubuntu (and derivatives as LinuxMint) to easily (un)install kernels from the [Ubuntu Kernel PPA](http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/).

Install
----------------
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pimlie/ubuntu-mainline-kernel.sh/master/ubuntu-mainline-kernel.sh
chmod +x ubuntu-mainline-kernel.sh
sudo mv ubuntu-mainline-kernel.sh /usr/local/bin/
apt install wget
```

If you want to automatically check for a new kernel version when you login:
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pimlie/ubuntu-mainline-kernel.sh/master/UbuntuMainlineKernel.desktop
mv UbuntuMainlineKernel.desktop ~/.config/autostart/
```

Warning
-----------------
Use this script at your own risk. You could remove all kernels with this script and leave your system unbootable. 
There are no safeguards that at least one kernel is installed on your system. Be especially careful with the `--yes` option.


Usage
-----------------
```
Usage: ubuntu-mainline-kernel.sh -c|-l|-r|-u

Download & install the latest kernel available from kernel.ubuntu.com

Arguments:
  -c               Check if a newer kernel version is available
  -i [VERSION]     Install kernel VERSION, see -l for list. You dont have to prefix
                   with v. E.g. -i 4.9 is the same as -i v4.9. If version is
                   omitted the latest available version will be installed
  -l [SEARCH]      List locally installedkernel versions. If an argument to this
                   option is supplied it will search for that
  -r [SEARCH]      List available kernel versions. If an argument to this option
                   is supplied it will search for that
  -u [VERSION]     Uninstall the specified kernel version. If version is omitted,
                   a list of max 10 installed kernel versions is displayed
  -h               Show this message

Optional:
  -p, --path DIR       The working directory, .deb files will be downloaded into 
                       this folder. If omitted, the folder /tmp/ubuntu-mainline-kernel.sh/ 
                       is used. Path is relative from $PWD
  -ll, --low-latency   Use the low-latency version of the kernel, only for amd64 & i386
  -lpae, --lpae        Use the Large Physical Address Extension kernel, only for armhf
  --snapdragon         Use the Snapdragon kernel, only for arm64
  -do, --download-only Only download the deb files, do not install them
  -ns, --no-signature  Do not check the gpg signature of the checksums file
  -nc, --no-checksum   Do not check the sha checksums of the .deb files
  -d, --debug          Show debug information, all internal command's echo their output
  --rc                 Also include release candidates
  --yes                Assume yes on all questions (use with caution!)
