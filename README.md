ubuntu-mainline-kernel.sh
=================

Bash script for Ubuntu (and derivatives as LinuxMint) to easily (un)install kernels from the [Ubuntu Kernel PPA](http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/).

Warnings
-----------------

:warning: Use this script at your own risk. Be aware that the kernels installed by this script are [unsupported](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/MainlineBuilds#Support_.28BEWARE:_there_is_none.29)

:unlock: Do not use this script if you don't have to or don't know what you are doing. You won't be [covered](https://github.com/pimlie/ubuntu-mainline-kernel.sh/issues/32) by any security guarantees. The intended purpose by Ubuntu for the mainline ppa kernels is for debugging issues.

:information_source: We strongly advise to keep the default Ubuntu kernel installed as there is no safeguard that at least one kernel is installed on your system.

Install
----------------

```bash
apt install wget
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pimlie/ubuntu-mainline-kernel.sh/master/ubuntu-mainline-kernel.sh
chmod +x ubuntu-mainline-kernel.sh
sudo mv ubuntu-mainline-kernel.sh /usr/local/bin/
```

If you want to automatically check for a new kernel version when you login:

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pimlie/ubuntu-mainline-kernel.sh/master/UbuntuMainlineKernel.desktop
mv UbuntuMainlineKernel.desktop ~/.config/autostart/
```

Usage
-----------------

```
Usage: ubuntu-mainline-kernel.sh -c|-l|-r|-u

Download & install the latest kernel available from kernel.ubuntu.com

Arguments:
  -c               Check if a newer kernel version is available
  -i [VERSION]     Install kernel VERSION, see -l for list. You don't have to prefix
                   with v. E.g. -i 4.9 is the same as -i v4.9. If version is
                   omitted the latest available version will be installed
  -l [SEARCH]      List locally installedkernel versions. If an argument to this
                   option is supplied it will search for that
  -r [SEARCH]      List available kernel versions. If an argument to this option
                   is supplied it will search for that
  -u [VERSION]     Uninstall the specified kernel version. If version is omitted,
                   a list of max 10 installed kernel versions is displayed
  -h               Show this message

Optional:
  -p, --path DIR       The working directory, .deb files will be downloaded into
                       this folder. If omitted, the folder /tmp/ubuntu-mainline-kernel.sh/
                       is used. Path is relative from $PWD
  -ll, --low-latency   Use the low-latency version of the kernel, only for amd64 & i386
  -lpae, --lpae        Use the Large Physical Address Extension kernel, only for armhf
  --snapdragon         Use the Snapdragon kernel, only for arm64
  -do, --download-only Only download the deb files, do not install them
  -ns, --no-signature  Do not check the gpg signature of the checksums file
  -nc, --no-checksum   Do not check the sha checksums of the .deb files
  -d, --debug          Show debug information, all internal command's echo their output
  --rc                 Also include release candidates
  --yes                Assume yes on all questions (use with caution!)

Dependencies
----------------

* bash
* gnucoreutils
* dpkg
* wget (since 2018-12-14 as kernel ppa is now https only)

Optional dependencies
----------------

* libnotify-bin (to show notify bubble when new version is found)
* bsdmainutils (format output of -l, -r with column)
* gpg (to check the signature of the checksum file)
* sha1sum/sha256sum (to check the .deb checksums)
* sudo

TODO
-----------------

-[ ] Support daily kernel builds (on hold until there is significant demand for this, PRs are also welcome)
